Problem Statement: Problem Statement: Churn Prediction for a Subscription-Based Business

Identify needs within the broader public or a specific business that help define the problem/product:
A subscription-based business ( A telecom provider), wants to reduce customer churn. Churn refers to the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions or stop using the service during a specific period. High churn rates can significantly impact revenue and growth potential. The business needs to identify customers who are at risk of churning and implement targeted retention strategies to keep them engaged.

Develop key requirements for the data product or solution:
The data product or solution should be able to predict churn for individual customers based on historical data. It should integrate with the business's customer database and transactional systems to access relevant information, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, billing history, and customer support interactions. The solution should be scalable and able to handle large volumes of customer data in real time to provide timely predictions.
